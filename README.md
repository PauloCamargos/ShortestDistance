# Shortest Distance

This program searches the shortest distance between two cities based on 
the Dijkstra's Algoritm. The language used here is Java.

Description: Through a interface, the user can define a 'origin' and a 
'destiny' city from a catalog of registered cities. When the button 
'Search route' is pressed, it is possible to see the shortest path 
from 'origin' to 'destiny' as well as a map of the region indicating 
that path.
